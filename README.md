# NTF: Nematode Tracking Data Filter and Threshold Refining Tool
This repository contains a Python-based tool for processing nematode tracking data, refining thresholds to distinguish between stationary and moving subjects, and creating a standalone executable (.exe) for easy distribution.

# Features
Data Filtering: Process tracking data to filter out predominantly stationary subjects.
Threshold Refining: Utilize Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to determine optimal thresholds for movement.
Standalone .exe Creation: Instructions and tools to package the Python script into a standalone executable for Windows.
